Installing Linux Notes
----------------------

## Distros

### POP\_OS
POP\_OS! is System76's Ubuntu flavored Linux Distro. It has a ton of basic defaults preconfigured 
including Gnome3 (my ideal). It's easy to break it down to what you want it to be too. 

## Software

### Firefox and Video Codecs
In order to watch Vimeo and Youtube videos properly:

  * Enable DRM Video in Firefox Options (this installs Googles DRM Codec Addon)
  * Make sure OpenH264 Addon is installed for Firefox
  * Install ffmpeg from the repos (installs the actual codecs)

### Terminal
HyperX terminal is the best replacement and easiest to setup of all the terminals. 
It handles all the modern fonts and it's a piece of cake to install addons via the `hyper` command.

### Emacs and Vim
Install from the various repos is the recommended method. Use git to install your specialized 
options.
